AVD Launcher is a simple tool made in Bash that allows running the Android SDK emulator without opening Android Studio or using command-line interface (terminal). You can also perform some operations with Android Virtual Device (AVD) opened: Install and Uninstall APKs, copy files to the AVD or AVD to the computer, install Google Apps (Android 4.3+ only) and send adb commands to the AVD.
